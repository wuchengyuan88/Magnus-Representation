This is the code accompanying the paper "Magnus Representation of Genome Sequences". (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/588582v1)

e1 to e69 are the genome sequences for the 69 filoviruses (data from GenBank).

b1 to b59 are bacterial sequences (data from GenBank).

magnusvector.py contains Python code to compute the Mean Magnus Vector of a genome sequence.

distance.py contains Python code to compute the distance matrix of genomes.
